## Jared T White
My name is Jared White, and I am a researcher in pure mathematics, as well as a university maths teacher and private maths tutor.

## Research Interests
### Key words
Group theory, functional analysis, abstract harmonic analysis, locally compact groups, discrete groups, Banach algebras, operator theory.
### Summary
My research is concerned with the Banach and operator algebras associated with locally compact groups, and seeks to better understand how properties of the underlying group are reflected in the associated algebras, and vice versa. I am motivated by a fascination with the interplay between abstract analysis and abstract algebra, and  I consider myself to be an analyst and algebraist in equal measure. One important aspect of this research has concerned better understanding the structure and properties of the (left/right/two-sided) ideals of these algebras.  Other interests of mine include amenability, semigroup Banach algebras, and direct finiteness of C\*-algebras on groups and semigroups.
